**neural-net-rs**

**Purpose:**

"neural-net-rs" is a Rust-based neural network framework designed for educational purposes. It aims to provide a clear and understandable implementation of basic neural network concepts using the Rust programming language.

**Functionality:**

* **Matrix Operations:** The `matrix.rs` module implements a `Matrix` struct and essential matrix operations like addition, multiplication, and transposition. A custom `matrix!` macro simplifies matrix creation.
* **Neural Network Structure:** The `network.rs` module defines the `Network` struct to represent a neural network, including layers, weights, biases, and an activation function.
* **Activation Functions:** The `activation.rs` module provides the sigmoid activation function and its derivative.
* **Training and Inference:** The `Network` struct implements `feed_forward` for forward propagation and `back_propagate` for training the network using backpropagation.
* **Example:** The `main.rs` module demonstrates the framework's use by training a network on the XOR problem.

**Overall, the project provides a foundational implementation of a neural network in Rust. Its focus on simplicity and clarity makes it a valuable educational tool for understanding the core principles behind neural networks.**
